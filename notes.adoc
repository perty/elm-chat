= WebSockets

== Security

You are npt allowed to subscribe to a topic that you have not been invited to or created.

Chat is not different than group conversations, it is just a group of two persons.

== Design

Using Stomp as I assume it will give some help. Spring has support for it. Offers a protocol fit for the purpose plus fallback alternatives.

But perhaps SockJS is enough for the fallback. STOMP seems not to be maintained. However, "_Why do we need STOMP? Well, WebSocket is just a communication protocol. It doesnâ€™t define things like - How to send a message only to users who are subscribed to a particular topic, or how to send a message to a particular user. We need STOMP for these functionalities._"

Found version 6 of STOMP here and it is maintained: `https://github.com/stomp-js/stompjs`

Plot thickens: "_For Spring STOMP users: There are few tutorials/guides that implicitly suggest that you need SockJS to use STOMP. That is incorrect, you only need SockJS if you need to support old browsers._"

Found elm-stomp, written by friends https://github.com/insurello/elm-stomp but not maintained.

Client connects and subscribes to the channels it has access to. Each channel is a topic.

When a client posts a message to a channel, that message is published to that topic.

Client receives the message and displays it. Each message has a unique id so that the client can know if it has seen it already.

== Tip

On the server side enable `TRACE` logging for `org.springframework.web.socket`.
