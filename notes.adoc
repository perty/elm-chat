= WebSockets

== Security

You are npt allowed to subscribe to a topic that you have not been invited to or created.

Chat is not different than group conversations, it is just a group of two persons.

== Design

Using Stomp as I assume it will give some help. Spring has support for it. Offers a protocol fit for the purpose plus fallback alternatives.

Client connects and subscribes to the channels it has access to. Each channel is a topic.

When a client posts a message to a channel, that message is published to that topic.

Client receives the message and displays it. Each message has a unique id so that the client can know if it has seen it already.
